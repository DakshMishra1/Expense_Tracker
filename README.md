# Expense_Tracker
A command-line expense tracker built with Python, designed as a simple, offline tool for managing personal finances. It features a secure login to protect user data. Users can log daily expenses into categories like Food and Clothes, and set both a total budget and specific limits for each category to actively manage spending.
